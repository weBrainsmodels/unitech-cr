This is a rubost School Management System in the making
It has Question Bank with features for Lecturers to add questions from their various Departments and Units.
Lecturers can be assigned Courses and are allowed to add assignment Scores for individual Student in the Course they are assigned to handle.
Departments are allowed to start their Exams just when they are ready to do so.
Each Department has previledges to decide whether or not a student who has not paid fees should seat for an Examination.
Should the Department permit students who owe fees to write Exams, the results may be published to the student's Self-Service Portal but not granted access to the Certificate unless he/she finally clares fees.
